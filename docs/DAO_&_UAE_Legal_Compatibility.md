# DAO & UAE Legal Compatibility

### *A Decentralized Initiative for Art, Technology & Collective Memory*  
**Global Park DAO | April 2025**

---

## Overview

Global Park DAO (GPARK) is a decentralized public initiative at the intersection of culture, architecture, and digital heritage, operating on a non-profit basis and coordinated through token-governed governance.

We provide an open framework for institutional and urban collaboration — bridging blockchain technology, physical space, and civic memory.

A frequent question from prospective collaborators in the UAE region is:

> **Is DAO-based governance and token coordination compatible with the UAE legal system?**

✅ **Short Answer:** Yes — through recognized precedents and emerging frameworks.

### 2. CitizenVoice (Dubai)

- Cultural recognition of non-profit, community-led initiatives
- Alignment with open-source governance tooling (ENS, IPFS, Gnosis Safe)
- Use cases that mirror local precedent:
  - Digital-physical memory inscription
  - Coordination of public art and urban experience
  - Participatory governance without profit orientation

## Conclusion

Global Park DAO is not only feasible within the UAE — it is structurally aligned with its strategic direction.

The initiative presents a new category of cultural infrastructure — one that is decentralized, transparent, and community-authored.

Participation is open to all public and private entities interested in helping shape this new layer of memory and presence. Institutions may:

- Acquire symbolic coordinates
- Join governance as DAO participants
- Propose cultural collaborations within the open framework of the DAO

All coordination is anchored via ENS:
