  Decisions are made through **binding Snapshot votes** by GPARK holders  
  The Council **executes decisions** without discretionary power

Participation is open to any wallet holding **unlocked GPARK tokens**.  
Proposals, funding, and governance changes follow a **transparent, documented process**

---

## 6. Public Good and Non-Profit Ethos
