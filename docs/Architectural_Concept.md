# Architectural Concept & Spatial Model

**A Decentralized Initiative for Art, Technology & Collective Memory**  
*Global Park DAO | April 2025*

## 1. Introduction: GPARK as a Participatory Space

GPARK is a physical cultural site shaped by decentralized collaboration.  
It exists as both a real-world environment and a digital map — where each contribution is recorded, represented, and preserved.

Participants do not “own” space.  
They contribute to it — by anchoring messages, initiating installations, and co-creating meaning.

The park is built from modular, expandable structures, coordinated through DAO governance. These include:

- Participation Wall  
- Panels and steles linked to NFT coordinates  
- Partner installations (pavilions, sculptural objects)  
- Open zones for events and IRL coordination  
- Proof-of-Presence check-in points  
- Gallery and reflection zones  
- Digital navigation via QR and ENS

Each element reflects decentralized authorship — not static design.

## 2. DAO Principles and Participatory Scaling

Every GPARK structure emerges through community coordination:

- Form, message, and materials are proposed via Snapshot  
- Objects are tied to digital coordinates on the park’s map  
- Funding is approved through the DAO treasury (via multisig)  
- Installations are reviewed for durability and alignment

Spatial contributions range in size:  
From individual panels (~1m²) to group zones (~25m²), each anchored to on-chain metadata.

No single person owns the park.  
Everyone contributes to its form.

## 3. The Participation Wall

The first and most symbolic structure:  
**The Participation Wall** — a living archive of early involvement.

- Built from modular blocks (30×15×10 cm) in concrete or clay  
- Each block includes:  
  - An engraved message  
  - An ENS or symbolic identity  
  - A QR/NFC tag linking to metadata  
- Placed in a collective pattern — not hierarchy  
- Coordinates fixed to a public map  
- Expandable across decades

**Wall length**: initially 10–30 meters, extendable by vote.  
This is not a donor wall.  
It is a memory wall — open to all who participate meaningfully.

## 4. Spatial Structure

The park is divided into evolving zones:

- **Founding Zone**: early messages and memorial contributions  
- **DAO Commons**: check-ins, event space, coordination rituals  
- **Institutional Coordinates**: museums, public groups, or civic partners  
- **Gallery Zone**: rotating exhibitions tied to community themes  
- **Reflection Areas**: silent zones for digital presence and contemplation

Each coordinate has a spatial ID and appears on the interactive DAO map.

## 5. Materials and Aesthetic Language

GPARK structures are made for time, weather, and meaning.

**Core materials**:

- Clay, stone, concrete, steel, glass  
- Embedded QR/NFC markers  
- Inscriptions with ENS names, quotes, coordinates

**Base modules**:

- 30×30×30 cm cubes  
- Fixed to elevated or ground-level platforms

**Partner works**:

- Max height: 3m  
- Max footprint: 5×5 m  
- Must adhere to park’s cultural integrity  
- Lighting and signage are integrated — minimal, ambient, and accessible

## 6. Examples of Contributions

Objects may include:

- “Message to the future” — a single engraved NFT block  
- Family panel — grouped messages across generations  
- DAO history stele — visualizing major votes or proposals  
- Museum presence block — symbolic ENS-tagged recognition  
- Podium for assemblies — where DAO meets IRL  
- Memorial for a shared moment — voted into place by community

These are not products.  
They are participatory forms of memory.

## 7. DAO-Based Creation Logic

Each installation is:

- Proposed via Snapshot  
- Approved through a transparent vote  
- Executed via DAO-managed treasury (Gnosis Safe)  
- Registered with on-chain metadata (IPFS, ENS)  
- Mapped to a coordinate with public visibility

**Holding a coordinate = right to propose and co-create**.  
It is a signal of authorship, not ownership.

The DAO curates, maintains, and evolves the space — openly.

## 8. Conclusion

GPARK is not an amusement park.  
Not a real estate zone.  
Not a museum.

It is a decentralized canvas for public presence — where architecture follows memory, and structure follows participation.

A space to:

- Leave a message  
- Spark a conversation  
- Co-create a legacy  
- See yourself in the public archive of a new cultural era

**This is not just a park. It is a DAO-space — a commons for decentralized heritage.**
