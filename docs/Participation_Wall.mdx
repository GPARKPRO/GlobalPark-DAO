# 🧱 **Participation Wall — Your Cultural Signature at the Heart of Global Park**

## What is it?

**Participation Wall** is a digital wall of recognition, cultural contribution, and personal expression located at the core of **Global Park** — the first decentralized cultural space of the next generation.

1000 unique tiles.  
1000 messages from those who were **first**.  
This is not just an NFT — it’s a **statement of presence**.  
Of belonging. Of influence. Of origin.

## Why does it matter?

### ✨ **Image. Prestige. Primacy.**

- Each tile on the Participation Wall is a visual placement on the official Global Park site.
- Early participants will occupy the most **visible** and **central** spots.
- Just like in architecture: **the first stones** set the foundation and shape the form.  
  Here, your tile becomes part of the **cultural groundwork of the DAO**.

## 🤝 **For Ambassadors and Influencers: This Is More Than an NFT**

### 📡 Continuous Traffic to Your Profile

Each tile includes:
- Your name or handle  
- A personal message  
- A link to your **Twitter/X** account  

🚀 **That means**: every visitor to the Global Park website will see your tile — and be able to visit your profile directly.  
This isn’t just a shoutout — it’s **organic traffic from a cultural Web3 hub**.

---

## 🧩 **A Message That Endures**

- You can leave a **word, phrase, link, or idea** that will be associated with you in the project forever.
- As Global Park grows and evolves — **your tile remains**, marking your early participation.

It’s like engraving your name in the marble of the Pompidou — or on the wall of the first Internet.

---

## 🌍 **Participation Connects Us**

- By joining the Participation Wall, you become part of the **cultural code of the DAO**.
- This isn’t about speculation. It’s about **identity and contribution**.
- You’ll be among the first 1000 who **set the cultural direction of the project**.
