Genesis Operating Rules

Global Park DAO – Governance Framework for Genesis Phase

⸻

1. Purpose

This document outlines the operational and governance principles for Global Park DAO during its initial (Genesis) phase.
At this stage, before public governance is activated, all decisions are executed by a DAO Council via multisignature control.

⸻

2. DAO Council
	•	Members: 5 designated wallet addresses
	•	Threshold: 3 of 5 signatures are required to execute any action
	•	Purpose: collective governance and decentralization safeguards
	•	Council Addresses:
	•	0x2e27D6811A9777633b14c046e6F1ce7D6e286A17
	•	0xcE72723445048fA89aF94d9DaFc93e3471Bb4F6D

	•	0xCB7aa26564a12de414882F0757D11E35BeDC1FF0

3. Council Powers

The DAO Council is authorized to:
	•	Manage the DAO treasury
	•	Execute privileged smart contract functions (e.g., lockTokens, snapshot)
	•	Publish and update ENS/IPFS records
	•	Initiate airdrops, grants, and partnerships
	•	Set up Snapshot governance (when ready)

⸻

4. No Public Voting During Genesis
	•	Snapshot and token-holder voting are not active during the Genesis phase
	•	All decisions are authorized internally via 3-of-5 multisignature approval
	•	Public governance will begin during the Autonomous Phase

⸻

5. Transparency
	•	All Council actions are executed on-chain through Gnosis Safe
	•	DAO structure is publicly recorded in the ENS profile globalpark.eth
	•	DAO Wallet Map is available at:
ipfs://bafkreibsz6wgrwuxks2yfhd45rrmdxsubsesvywyajchflyrfrtxy5kj2m

⸻

6. Transition to Autonomous Governance

Global Park DAO will transition to public, token-based governance when any of the following conditions are met:
	•	6 months have passed since DAO activation
	•	20% or more of GPARK tokens are in active circulation
	•	At least 100 unique token holders are verified
	•	The DAO Council votes to initiate the transition
	•	Snapshot is deployed and first governance proposal is held with quorum

⸻

7. Execution Address Policy

The deployer address of the GPARK token (0xa22a70863e3b5723a5c732632139E1a7Bd0a637D)
retains execution rights required by the smart contract but is no longer individually controlled.
This address is used solely for the execution of DAO-approved actions, under 3-of-5 DAO Council consensus.
Its private key is secured through hardware or MPC protocols.
No privileged actions can be performed unilaterally from this address.
