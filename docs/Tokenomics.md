# 1. Introduction

**GPARK** is not an investment token, but a **non-financial utility asset** at the center of the architectural design of a decentralized cultural space.  
It enables:
- Activation
- Participation
- Governance
- Coordination  
within the **Global Park DAO ecosystem**.

This document outlines the **economic model of the GPARK token**, including:
- Distribution framework
- Usage principles
- Sustainable growth mechanisms fully aligned with DAO governance and community participation

---

In accordance with decentralized governance and the absence of centralized issuance, **GPARK tokenomics** is based on the following core principles:

- **Scarcity:**  
Total token supply is permanently capped at **21,000,000 GPARK**.  
No further issuance is possible.

- **Transparency:**  
Token allocations, vesting schedules, and DAO treasury operations are fully visible and verifiable **on-chain**.

- **Participation over profit:**  
The token does not offer:
  - Financial guarantees
  - Profit-sharing
  - Yield  
It is a **coordination tool for cultural activation and network contribution**.

- **DAO governance:**  
All token and treasury management is executed via:
  - **Snapshot voting**
  - **Gnosis Safe multisig approvals**
  - **Open DAO infrastructure**

---

This document is intended for:
- Community members
- Partners
- Exchanges
- Grant organizations
- Institutions
- Other stakeholders engaging with GPARK as a **cultural coordination asset** — not as a speculative instrument.

---

# 2. Purpose and Nature of the GPARK Token

The **GPARK token** was designed as a **key to unlock the architecture and community participation** of the **Global Park project**.  
It is:
- ❌ Not a security
- ❌ Not an investment contract
- ❌ Not a passive income vehicle

Its role:
- Enable fair access
- Activate community participation
- Support ecosystem coordination through **verifiable, non-financial usage**

---

## Core Functions of GPARK

### ✦ Access to Infrastructure

GPARK is required to:
- Register NFT coordinates
- Access gated cultural spaces
- Rent real-life (**IRL**) installations
- Participate in dynamic park activations

---

### ✦ DAO Governance Participation

- Any wallet holding **100+ unlocked GPARK** may vote in DAO proposals via Snapshot
- Any wallet holding **5,000+ unlocked GPARK** may submit proposals

DAO votes control:
- Project direction
- Funding allocations
- Ecosystem evolution

---

### ✦ Staking and Proof-of-Presence Mechanics

GPARK may be staked to:
- Unlock access rights
- Gain participation scores
- Determine event eligibility
- Mint NFTs

❗ No financial yield or rewards are attached to staking.

---

### ✦ Recording Contributions

GPARK acts as an **on-chain marker** of participation in:
- Cultural initiatives
- Events
- Partnerships
- Community memory projects

---

## Token Properties

- **Immutable:**  
The GPARK contract prohibits:
  - Additional minting
  - Ownership changes
  - Admin control functions

- **DAO-managed:**  
All actions related to GPARK:
  - Distributions
  - Vesting
  - Partner allocations  
can only occur via **DAO-approved proposals executed through Gnosis Safe**

- **Non-financial:**  
GPARK does not represent:
  - Financial gain
  - Dividend rights
  - Ownership shares
  - Yield mechanisms

- **Anti-speculative Design:**  
GPARK derives value purely from:
- Active participation
- Cultural contribution
- Scarce access to space within the **Global Park ecosystem**

---

# 3. Total Supply and Emission Properties

The total supply of **GPARK tokens** is permanently set at **21,000,000 units**, fully minted at contract deployment.  
The supply is **immutable** and cannot be changed or recreated under any circumstances.

This limited-supply structure reflects the philosophy of the **Global Park project**:  
> A meaningful, finite cultural space requires a meaningful, finite coordination token.

---

## Key Emission Properties

- **Fixed Supply**  
The contract includes no `mint()` function or any other mechanism for generating additional tokens.  
The total supply is final and irreversible.

- **DAO Treasury Ownership**  
The token contract uses an **Ownable model** where the **DAO Treasury (multisig wallet)** acts as the contract owner.  
Transfer of ownership is permanently disabled.

- **No Pre-Mine or Private Allocations**  
All token allocations were defined publicly in the **Genesis phase** and verifiable on-chain.  
There are no hidden founder allocations or private pre-sale rounds.

- **No Inflationary Mechanics**  
GPARK includes no staking rewards, farming emissions, or automatic inflation loops.  
All ecosystem allocations must be **DAO-approved** and executed via **Gnosis Safe**.

- **DAO-Governed Distribution**  
All distributions of GPARK for:
  - Grants
  - Contributors
  - Partnerships
  - Initiatives  
can only be executed by **DAO proposal + multisig confirmation**, ensuring total decentralization and community control.

---

# 4. Token Allocation

The **GPARK token distribution** is designed to support:
- Sustainability
- Transparency
- Long-term coordination through DAO governance

All actions related to token movement are:
- Verifiably recorded **on-chain**
- Fully governed by **Snapshot proposals**
- Executed by **DAO-approved multisig**

The total fixed supply remains permanently capped at **21,000,000 GPARK**, with no ability to mint additional tokens.

# 4.2 Allocation Principles

The GPARK distribution framework follows these guiding principles:

- **DAO-first architecture**  
The majority of tokens are controlled by the DAO or distributed through DAO-approved programs.

- **Long-term alignment**  
Team tokens are frozen and vested over an extended schedule to ensure contribution and discourage speculative behavior.

- **Fair liquidity provisioning**  
Exchange liquidity exists from Day 1 via the DAO reserve but is never used for price intervention.

- **Proof-of-Participation over speculation**  
Early supporter allocations and staking incentives are tied to meaningful contributions, not trading volume or passive holding.

- **Institutional onboarding with transparency**  
The Partnerships pool enables key collaborators to join with minimum lockups and full community oversight.

- **Strategic flexibility**  
The DAO retains a small reserve for unforeseen needs or future DAO-voted ecosystem expansions.

---

# 5. Vesting & Token Locking

**Vesting** is a critical mechanism designed to:
- Ensure the long-term sustainability of the **GPARK ecosystem**
- Protect the DAO from short-term speculative behavior

All major internal allocations — including:
- Core Team
- DAO Council
- Partnerships  
are **locked by default** and released gradually based on transparent and preset schedules.

---

## 5.1 Vesting Rules for the Core Team and DAO Council

- **Total allocation:** 3,000,000 GPARK
- **Initial lock period (cliff):** 12 months (**until May 2026**)
- **Linear release:** over 24 months at a rate of **125,000 GPARK per month**
- **Full vesting completion:** May 2028
- **Enforcement:** On-chain via DAO-controlled `lockTokens()` function

---

These tokens:
- Remain **non-transferable**
- Cannot be used for:
  - Voting
  - Staking
  - Selling during the lock period

> Vesting guarantees **governance integrity** and **long-term commitment**.

---

## 5.2 Lock Rules for Institutional Partners

Each institutional partnership or grant allocation must follow a lock-up schedule to:
- Align with DAO values
- Prevent opportunistic behavior

### Rules:
- **Mandatory lock period:** 6 to 12 months (defined individually per case)
- Lock conditions and unlock schedules must be:
  - Publicly documented
  - Pre-approved by DAO vote
- Unlock events must be transparent, with all data visible on:
  - DAO dashboard
  - Blockchain explorers

---

## 5.3 Technical Implementation

All locked tokens are stored within the **GPARK smart contract**.  
The DAO Treasury (via multisig) uses the `lockTokens()` function to:
- Assign locks
- Set unlock dates to any address

DAO members and the public can verify lock and unlock status via:

- `getUnlockedBalance(address)`
- `lockedAmount(address)`
- `getNextUnlockDate(address)`

These functions are:
- Open
- Permissionless
- Accessible through explorers or the DAO dashboard

---

# 6. Token Utility & Use Cases

The **GPARK token** is not intended for passive holding or speculation.  
Its purpose is to enable:
- Access
- Contribution
- Governance
- Infrastructure activation  
within the **Global Park DAO ecosystem**.

All utilities are **non-financial** and can evolve via **DAO proposals**.

---

## 6.1 DAO Staking & Voting Access

Participation in governance requires staking:

- **Voting rights:**  
Holders must stake at least **100 unlocked GPARK** to participate in Snapshot votes.

- **Proposal rights:**  
Holders must stake at least **5,000 unlocked GPARK** to submit new proposals.

- **Additional staking tiers (optional):**  
May be introduced by DAO vote for:
  - Access to events
  - XP boosts
  - NFT activations

❗ No APY or financial returns are associated with staking.  
Staking is purely an **access and participation mechanism**.

---

## 6.2 Proof-of-Presence (PoP)

**GPARK tokens** can be linked to participation through verifiable real-world activities:

- Scanning QR/NFC checkpoints at park installations
- Attending events, exhibitions, meetups, and partner spaces
- Engaging in verified cultural initiatives

Participants may receive:
- NFT badges
- Proof-of-Presence records
- Increased XP within the DAO

❌ No financial reward is granted.  
These are **cultural and governance status tools**.

---

## 6.3 NFT Activation & Coordinate Ownership

Each NFT within **Global Park** represents a **unique spatial coordinate**.

- Activation, minting, upgrades, and transfers require payment in GPARK
- Some advanced actions may optionally involve **token burning** as an ecosystem-sustaining deflation mechanism
- Coordinate NFTs can be:
  - Staked
  - Rented
  - Delegated through DAO mechanisms
- NFTs act as **infrastructure keys** for access to digital objects and IRL modules

---

## 6.4 Participation in DAO Initiatives

GPARK serves as the internal coordination unit of value for:
- DAO grants
- Contributor budget proposals
- Ecosystem initiative applications
- Mission completions and community challenges

Distributions are made from the **DAO-controlled Staking & Participation Pool** upon:
- Snapshot vote
- Automated mechanisms

---

## 6.5 Contribution Recognition

Any verified action within the DAO may lead to:
- XP boosts
- DAO reputation
- NFT badges
- Access credentials

Examples of qualifying actions:
- Voting
- Proposal creation
- Event participation
- Cultural contribution

GPARK serves as:
- **Proof of contribution**
- **Community reputation signal**
- **Dynamic identity and participation layer** inside the DAO

---

# 7. Demand, Circulation & Growth Mechanics

The **GPARK token model** is intentionally designed as a:
- Non-speculative
- Non-yield
- Access-driven coordination asset

Utility and value emerge exclusively from:
- **Active ecosystem participation**
- Not from passive holding or external hype

---

## 7.1 Controlled Circulation

At launch, only a limited portion of tokens enter circulation.  
Major categories:
- Team
- Partnerships
- Participation rewards  
remain locked or are distributed gradually under **DAO-approved conditions**.

This prevents early holders from distorting DAO access and maintains fairness by tying participation rights to **active contributions**.

---

## 7.2 Burn-to-Utility Mechanism

Certain community actions require irreversible burning of GPARK tokens:
- Upgrading NFTs
- Unlocking premium tools or experiences
- Accessing rare coordinates or high-tier privileges
- Submitting certain enhanced DAO proposals (to avoid spam)

This mechanism:
- Reduces circulating supply
- Rewards active participants by increasing overall scarcity

---

## 7.3 Real-World Anchoring

GPARK is a **scarce access key** for hybrid on-chain and real-world activations:

- Every IRL installation, digital object, or park coordinate is linked to a tokenized NFT
- Access, activation, or proposal submission always requires GPARK involvement
- The token bridges **blockchain governance with physical cultural presence**

---

## 7.4 Multi-Phase Growth

The GPARK utility roadmap anticipates expansion across:

- **Governance:**  
Advanced DAO modules, subDAOs, curated treasuries

- **Physical presence:**  
IRL festivals, exhibitions, cultural city partnerships

- **Cross-chain bridges:**  
Collaboration with partner ecosystems and multi-chain deployments

- **Open tooling APIs:**  
Allowing external builders and dApps to integrate GPARK coordination functions

---

# 8. Future Modules & Expansion Architecture

The **GPARK token** uses a **modular expansion design**.  
New ecosystem features can be added via **DAO-approved contracts** without modifying the core ERC20 token contract.

All future modules interact with GPARK via:
- Open-standard interfaces (`ITokenomics`, `IERC20`, `IERC721`)
- Must be activated via **DAO Snapshot voting**

---

## 8.1 Participation Staking Module

- Community may introduce a staking mechanism via DAO proposal
- Staking GPARK may unlock access tiers for:
  - Participation
  - XP
  - Event eligibility
  - Commemorative NFTs
- ❌ No APY or financial yield can be attached under any conditions
- Potential multi-tier design (e.g. Bronze / Silver / Gold) remains purely symbolic for contribution tracking

---

## 8.2 Burn-to-Upgrade Engine

Burning GPARK allows holders to:
- Evolve their NFTs
- Gain XP and level up DAO reputation
- Unlock rare map coordinates
- Trigger coordinate transformations

This promotes:
- Deflation
- Engagement
- Community gamification  
without financial speculation

---

## 8.3 NFT Integration Layer

- All NFT minting, upgrades, and trading require GPARK usage
- Each NFT is tied to a **digital or physical coordinate**

Future DAO-approved features may include:
- Renting coordinates (DAO defines terms)
- Transfer of rights by community vote
- Linking NFT ownership to real-world installations

---

## 8.4 Proof-of-Presence (PoP) Engine

GPARK tokens may be staked (frozen) to unlock participation rights:
- Voting access
- Event participation
- Special NFT drops

Check-ins are validated via:
- QR
- NFC
- Geolocation

Proofs are:
- Recorded on-chain
- Rewarded via XP or DAO reputation, not financial tokens

---

## 8.5 DAO Reputation & Contribution Tracking

- Community participation is measured via XP and recorded in DAO profiles
- Snapshot governance and ENS profiles may display reputation weight
- High-contributors may earn non-transferable badges or titles voted by DAO
- Reputation grows organically through **sustained participation over time**

---

## 8.6 Ecosystem Stabilization Treasury

- The DAO may vote to allocate surplus funds from:
  - Partnerships
  - Events
  - Sponsorships  
to reduce circulating supply

- Any such actions must be:
  - Transparently approved by Snapshot proposal
  - This mechanism is optional and does not represent a core DAO policy

---

## 8.7 Modular Governance & SubDAOs

- The DAO may approve the creation of specialized subDAOs (e.g. for architecture, events, education)
- GPARK remains the **unifying governance and coordination token**
- SubDAOs may receive budgets based on:
  - Performance
  - Community voting

- ❌ No centralized entity can activate or modify modules without full DAO approval

---
This structure allows **Global Park DAO** to:
- Expand iteratively
- Remain fully community-driven
- Operate under open governance principles

---
