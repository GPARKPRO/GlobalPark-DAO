# 🔑 **GENESIS KEY — The First NFT of Global Park**

## What is GENESIS KEY?

**GENESIS KEY** is the very first NFT of **Global Park DAO** — a cultural utility token that grants access, recognition, and lasting presence within the most meaningful areas of our ecosystem.

- Only **1000 GENESIS KEY NFTs** will ever exist.
- They are the **entry pass** to the **Participation Wall**, the first **real-world monument**, and **on-chain coordination tools**.
- Each key is more than a collectible — it’s a marker of **founding participation**.

## 🌐 Why GENESIS KEY Matters

This isn’t a speculative asset.  
It’s a **cultural artifact** — a digital heirloom from the dawn of the Global Park movement.

### As a GENESIS KEY holder, you get:

- 🧱 **Guaranteed placement** on the Participation Wall (digital cultural wall on the official website)
- 🧱 **Guaranteed placement** on the **physical Wall of Founders**, in the first architectural object we build
- 🎁 Participation in the **GENESIS AIRDROP** (between **1M–2M GPARK tokens** distributed across 1000 NFTs)
- 📦 Access to **GENESIS BOX** — randomized token drops tied to your NFT ID
- 🔓 Unlocking utility across future DAO tools, zones, and voting
- 🎨 A lifelong connection to a **community shaping cultural legacy**

## 🎁 GENESIS AIRDROP: A Thank You to Early Builders

We will airdrop **between 1,000,000 and 2,000,000 GPARK tokens** among **1000 GENESIS KEY NFTs**.

> 💡 Exact amount per NFT will vary based on:
> - Participation in quests, proposals, and activities  
> - Snapshot holdings  
> - Small element of randomness  
> - Era-based drop mechanics (see below)

There is **no guaranteed financial value** — this is a gesture of cultural and governance inclusion.  
You are **not buying for return**, but participating in something greater.

## 🔄 Era-Based Minting System

The 1000 GENESIS KEY NFTs are released across **10 eras**, 100 keys per era:

| Era | Supply | Price (GPARK) | Box Openings | Token Range | Jackpot Chance |
|-----|--------|---------------|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| 1   | 100    | 100           | 12 per key   | 19–33 tokens | 5% chance of 100 tokens |
| 2   | 100    | 200           | 12 per key   | 38–66 tokens | 5% chance of 200 tokens |
| 3–10 | TBD   | TBD           | TBD          | TBD          | TBD |

- After each era sells out, the next era begins.
- Price, reward size, and mechanics **may evolve** — reinforcing early participation as more meaningful.
