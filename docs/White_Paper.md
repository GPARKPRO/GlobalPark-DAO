# 1. Executive Summary

**Global Park DAO** is a decentralized initiative at the intersection of **art, technology, and collective memory**.  
Built on **Ethereum** and governed by a **multisignature DAO Council**, the project seeks to redefine how physical and digital spaces can coexist through a shared, blockchain-anchored cultural ecosystem.

In a world where creative expression is often siloed, monetized, and owned by closed systems, **Global Park** proposes a radically open and transparent model. The park is not simply a physical location — it is a living layer of programmable space, shaped by its community and made scarce by design. Every object, digital or physical, represents a unique coordinate in a new kind of landscape, powered by the **GPARK token** and curated by collective governance.

The DAO introduces a system where individuals, creators, and institutions can co-create and claim presence within the park. While the token offers no promise of profit, its utility serves only as a **participation and coordination tool for cultural activation and community engagement**. In this structure, every participant becomes a potential builder, contributor, or steward.

What makes **Global Park** unique is its long-view design: every phase, from token launch to real-world deployment, is **documented, governed, and executed through open-source infrastructure**.  
The scarcity of park space is not a limitation — it is an **invitation to participate early, intentionally, and meaningfully** in a cultural landmark of the decentralized era.

# 2. Vision and Philosophical Foundation

## 2.1 Vision: Decentralized Cultural Landscape

**Global Park DAO** is a next-generation cultural system in which digital artifacts (**NFTs**) become the foundation for creating physical installations, public spaces, and architectural expressions of memory.

We are building more than just a token ecosystem — we’re designing a **living cultural landscape**, where each unit of digital heritage is:
- Anchored in space
- Tied to coordinates
- Brought to life

This park exists in **three parallel dimensions**:
- **Physically** — as an evolving, walkable terrain of architecture, sculptures, and curated spaces.
- **On-chain** — as a DAO-managed structure of governance, token utility, and NFT provenance.
- **Culturally** — as a long-term initiative that safeguards, co-creates, and archives collective memory.

The ultimate goal of **GPARK** is to create the world’s **first decentralized cultural landscape** — not governed by centralized institutions or private interests, but by a **transparent, token-based protocol of participation and presence**.

Each NFT is not just a collectible — it’s a **programmable coordinate, a signal of contribution, and a permanent fixture in a shared spatial narrative**.

---

## 2.2 Philosophy: Art, Transparency, Memory

**Global Park DAO** arises from a simple yet vital idea: **culture, art, and memory deserve decentralized foundations**.

We envision a future in which both physical and digital spaces are:
- Not owned or exploited,
- But **co-created, protected, and activated by the communities** that inhabit them.

While institutions and cities are often shaped by invisible hierarchies, **GPARK** offers an alternative — a programmable space where **rules, access, and growth are defined not by private control, but by consensus**.

Our philosophical base rests on **three pillars**:
1. **Art as infrastructure** – not decoration, but the backbone of public architecture.
2. **Technology as transparency** – every decision, transaction, and permission is recorded on-chain.
3. **Memory as coordination** – every object is not just a file or sculpture, but a fragment of shared significance.

Aligned with long-term cultural frameworks such as **Dubai 2040**, the project is not speculative — it is architectural.  
Every coordinate, every participant, every block on-chain is a **building block in a decentralized cultural future**.

---

# 3. Digital Heritage: From NFTs to Physical Presence

**Global Park** is not only a place — it is a **living memory system**.  
At the heart of this system lies the **NFT layer**, which enables:
- Digital representation
- Cultural imprinting
- Permanent anchoring of contributions to the park’s landscape

Each NFT minted within the **Global Park ecosystem** corresponds to a:
- Specific coordinate
- Object
- Memory
- Conceptual presence

These are not generic collectibles, but rather **nodes of cultural inheritance** — programmable, visible, and co-authored by the community.

---

### The NFT layer serves the following roles:

- **Spatial Representation** – Each NFT may be tied to a specific zone, object, or experience within the park.
  
- **Cultural Recognition & Participation** – NFTs act as symbolic badges of early contribution and community engagement.  
  Holders will be permanently recognized on the **Global Park Participation Wall** (both online and in the physical park).  
  NFTs do not grant voting rights in DAO governance, which remains exclusively tied to GPARK token holdings.
  
- **Curation & Preservation** – NFTs can be used to curate shared memories, represent artist contributions, or mark meaningful moments in the DAO’s timeline.

---

In the **Genesis Phase**, Global Park will launch an initial limited collection of NFTs available through **single-mint per wallet**.  
These NFTs serve as **early contributor badges and participation artifacts**, not as governance tokens.

Each NFT will be:
- Linked to **ENS metadata**
- Registered on **IPFS** to ensure decentralization and long-term verifiability

Ownership of NFTs:
- Does not provide governance rights
- Does not provide staking rewards
- Does not provide financial returns
- Does not imply any claim over DAO assets

> **NFTs are strictly participation artifacts.**

5. DAO Governance Architecture
The long-term mission of Global Park DAO is to evolve into a fully community-governed and decentralized organization. However, we recognize that in the early Genesis Phase the project must prioritize operational stability, security, and infrastructure development. Therefore, the initial governance model is based on a temporary Council structure, with a clear and irreversible roadmap toward community-driven governance.
The most critical milestone of this journey is building a strong and inclusive community of DAO participants. Our first roadmap priority is to activate mass community onboarding and token distribution to transition governance as soon as possible from the founding Council to a full DAO model.
To ensure maximum fairness and openness, the project conducts an early public listing with no private sales, no VC allocations, and no exclusive investor rounds. Every participant will have an equal opportunity to acquire GPARK tokens and join DAO governance on transparent and equal terms.
The DAO operates on a robust and verifiable framework combining multisignature treasury control, on-chain records, and progressive decentralization.
DAO Council
A five-member DAO Council, each with an independently held wallet, is responsible for treasury transactions, protocol changes, and execution of DAO decisions. All actions require a 3-of-5 multisignature approval via Gnosis Safe.
This Council acts strictly as a steward in the Genesis Phase, with no intention of permanent control. Its role is to protect, activate, and document the foundational stages of DAO formation.
5.1 Voting & Proposal Thresholds
To encourage early and broad community participation while maintaining protection from spam and bad actors, Global Park DAO implements the following participation structure:
* Voting Rights: Any Ethereum wallet holding at least 100 unlocked GPARK tokens is eligible to vote on Snapshot proposals.
* Proposal Submission: Submitting a formal proposal requires holding at least 5,000 unlocked GPARK tokens, or receiving community endorsement via off-chain forum upvotes.
* Delegation: Any GPARK holder may delegate their voting rights to another wallet.
These thresholds are designed to provide maximum inclusivity at the entry level, while ensuring governance quality at the proposal stage. They can be amended only by future DAO voting after the transition to the Autonomous Phase.
DAO Treasury (Gnosis Safe)
Treasury Address: 0xd45BA3Fb796CD735715aB6966f198d416EC353C1
The central treasury wallet holds and distributes funds (ETH, GPARK, and NFT revenue) strictly according to approved DAO proposals.
Token Contract Ownership
The GPARK token contract is fully owned by the DAO Treasury. No single actor holds admin rights. All privileged functions require Council multisig approval during the Genesis Phase.
IPFS Governance Records
All key documents (Genesis Rules, DAO Wallet Map, Launch Reports) are pinned and verifiable via IPFS, and anchored to the ENS domain.


ENS Metadata
The DAO’s on-chain identity eth holds links to all DAO-controlled addresses, documents, and governance updates.
The governance roadmap defines a structured transition:
1. Genesis Phase (current): Council-led stewardship with DAO community formation.
2. Autonomous Phase (future): Community-led governance via Snapshot voting by GPARK token holders.
Upon completion of the transition, the DAO Council’s role will shift to purely advisory or will be dissolved entirely by community vote.

# 6. The GPARK Token

The **GPARK token** is the native utility asset of the **Global Park DAO ecosystem**.  
It is not a financial instrument, but rather a key that unlocks **participation, coordination, and activation** across both digital and physical dimensions of the park.

Issued through a **fully deployed and immutable smart contract on Ethereum**, the GPARK token serves three primary functions:

- **Governance Participation** – In future phases, any Ethereum wallet holding at least **100 unlocked GPARK tokens** will be able to vote on DAO proposals via Snapshot.  
Submitting a formal proposal requires holding at least **5,000 GPARK tokens** or community endorsement through forum upvotes.  
Governance parameters are finalized by community vote once sufficient distribution and participation levels are reached.

- **Access to Scarce Infrastructure** – The park is physically limited. GPARK tokens will be required to register digital coordinates, sponsor installations, or represent contributions in collaborative zones.

- **Cultural Activation** – GPARK tokens may be required to engage in certain events, mint NFT objects tied to specific coordinates, or represent verified participation in collective memory projects.

---

The smart contract address is:  
`0x470AAb2A10F3b0757Df977C39dDe3475F76f81B9`

GPARK is an **ERC20-compatible token** with extended features including:
- `ERC20Permit (EIP-2612)`
- `ERC20Votes (Snapshot-compatible)`
- A built-in **vesting mechanism for contributors and partners**

The contract includes:
- ❌ No minting privileges
- ❌ No transfer of ownership
- ❌ No admin functions  
A limited portion of tokens are subject to lock-up and vesting mechanisms, managed via **DAO-approved execution**.

There is **no expectation of profit or investment return**. GPARK is not designed to be held as a speculative asset, but as a **functional resource** for participation within the DAO’s governance, tools, and cultural ecosystem.

By design, value is created **not through price speculation**, but through **activation, contribution, and cultural relevance**.

# 6.1 Token Utility, Scarcity, and DAO-Supported Value

GPARK is a **utility token** at the core of the **Global Park DAO architecture**.  
It is not a financial instrument but plays a critical role in:
- Participation
- Access
- Ecosystem expansion

Every NFT within the park represents a **unique, fixed coordinate** — a zone that can be used for:
- Cultural installations
- Presence anchoring
- Physical activation

Claiming symbolic space is possible through **NFT ownership as a participation artifact**.  
Governance rights remain exclusively tied to **GPARK token holdings**.

Minting, transferring, and activating NFTs requires **GPARK**.  
As the DAO community grows, **participation requirements** and **community contribution thresholds** may evolve by DAO governance.

The total supply of NFTs is **capped and will not be expanded**.  
The park is designed with **fixed boundaries** — this is not artificial scarcity, but an **architectural principle reflecting the physical world**.

---

### Economic Logic and DAO Incentive Structure

GPARK is **not intended for financial speculation**.  
DAO mechanisms are focused on sustaining:
- Community participation
- Ecosystem engagement

This includes:
- Supporting the physical creation of park installations
- Developing governance tooling and infrastructure
- Enabling cultural programming and activations
- Expanding global partnerships and institutional outreach

The DAO does not manage or guarantee the price of GPARK.  
Token and NFT-related transactions return value to the **DAO treasury**, which is exclusively used for:
- Ecosystem development
- Community initiatives

No funds are distributed to token holders as financial returns.

If any increase in token or NFT prices occurs, it serves to support **cultural infrastructure and public benefit**, not personal gain.

---

# 6.2 Tokenomics Expansion: Future Modules

While the GPARK token is launched as a **clean, immutable, and DAO-governed asset**, its architecture allows for **future modular expansion** by community decision.  
Any introduction of staking or utility mechanisms will be defined by **DAO voting** and may evolve as the community deems fit.

---

## The following modules are part of the current roadmap:

### 1️⃣ GPARK Staking Module

- Mechanism for long-term token lockup with community recognition multipliers
- Staking GPARK enhances participation weight and engagement levels
- Multi-tiered contribution tiers:
  - Community
  - Builder
  - Steward
- ❗ All staking features will be defined, modified, or discontinued by future DAO proposals and community voting

---

### 2️⃣ Burn-to-Utility / Upgrade Engine

- Burn GPARK to:
  - Evolve NFTs
  - Gain XP or reputation levels
  - Activate park zones
- Designed for compatibility with dynamic NFT systems

---

### 3️⃣ NFT Integration & Cultural Coordinates

- NFT minting and trading will be exclusively powered by GPARK
- Each NFT represents a **unique coordinate** in the park’s digital ecosystem

Future possibilities:
- Renting coordinates
- Transferring ownership via DAO vote
- Mapping real-world installations to NFT ownership

---

### 4️⃣ Staking as Access / Proof of Participation

- Locking GPARK can enhance voting influence, grant access to events or NFT drops
- Governance rights are fundamentally tied to token balance, not staking
- Staking mechanics are subject to future community governance decisions

---

### 5️⃣ Interactive Governance & DAO Rewards

- XP-based community recognition
- Proposal ranking and anonymous governance experiments
- Voting on park design and public initiatives

---

### 6️⃣ IRL Integration & Check-In System (Proof-of-Presence)

- Earn NFTs or community rewards by physically visiting park installations
- Verification via QR, NFC, or geolocation technologies

---

The DAO may allocate revenues for:
- Community incentives
- Participation support

❗ No market buybacks, price guarantees, or deflationary burns are promised or implied.

Technical specs and DAO governance logic for each module will be published individually on GitHub.  
Developers and partners are encouraged to track progress and contribute to proposals through the [**GPARK public repository →**](https://github.com/GPARKPRO/GlobalPark-DAO).

---

# 7. Treasury & Financial Design

**Global Park DAO** maintains a **transparent, on-chain treasury** governed by a **3-of-5 multisignature Council**.  
The treasury:
- Is not controlled by any single individual or entity
- Operates solely through **DAO-approved actions**

---

### Treasury Address (Gnosis Safe)

`0xd45BA3Fb796CD735715aB6966f198d416EC353C1`

All funds — whether:
- ETH
- GPARK tokens
- NFT-related income  
are managed through this Safe and remain **fully viewable by the public**.

---

### Council-Controlled Execution

Every outgoing transaction must be approved by at least **three of five Council members**, with all activity verifiable on-chain.  
This governance design ensures:
- Maximum transparency
- Accountability
- Resilience against centralized misuse

---

### Funding Philosophy

**Global Park is not an investment vehicle.**  
The DAO is a **public-good oriented cultural structure**, where funds are intended to support:
- Infrastructure
- Community engagement
- Art projects
- Maintenance
- Development

There are:
- ❌ No profit guarantees
- ❌ No funds will be used to enrich any single actor

---

### Sources of Treasury Growth (Non-Speculative)

- Minting fees from NFTs
- Cultural partnerships and curation programs
- Grants or public support funds
- Contributions from aligned DAOs or institutions
- Token-based community initiatives

---

### Spending Principles

- All expenditures must be:
  - Proposed
  - Documented
  - Approved by the DAO
  
- Spending is evaluated based on:
  - Mission alignment
  - Cultural/public value

- Budgets may include:
  - Infrastructure
  - IRL activations
  - Digital tooling
  - DAO operations

---

> The treasury exists not to accumulate wealth,  
> but to **sustain, activate, and grow a living cultural ecosystem**.  
> Every token, every ETH spent, is a form of **participation in a shared legacy**.
