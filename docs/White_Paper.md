## 1️⃣ Executive Summary

Global Park DAO is a decentralized initiative at the intersection of **art, technology, and collective memory**.  
Built on **Ethereum** and governed by a **multisignature DAO Council**, the project seeks to redefine how physical and digital spaces can coexist through a shared, blockchain-anchored cultural ecosystem.

In a world where creative expression is often siloed, monetized, and owned by closed systems, Global Park proposes a **radically open and transparent model**.  
The park is not simply a physical location — it is a living layer of programmable space, shaped by its community and made scarce by design.  
Every object, digital or physical, represents a **unique coordinate** in a new kind of landscape, powered by the **GPARK token** and curated by collective governance.

The DAO introduces a system where **individuals, creators, and institutions** can co-create and claim presence within the park.  
While the token offers **no promise of profit**, its utility as a gateway to limited physical space and network-based collaboration presents an **asymmetric opportunity for value generation**.  
In this structure, every participant becomes a potential **builder, contributor, or steward**.

What makes Global Park unique is its **long-view design**:
- Every phase, from token launch to real-world deployment, is documented, governed, and executed through **open-source infrastructure**.
- The scarcity of park space is not a limitation — it is an **invitation to participate early, intentionally, and meaningfully** in a cultural landmark of the decentralized era.

---

## 2️⃣ Vision and Philosophical Foundation

### 2.1 ✦ Vision: Decentralized Cultural Landscape

Global Park DAO is a **next-generation cultural system** in which digital artifacts (**NFTs**) become the foundation for creating physical installations, public spaces, and architectural expressions of memory.

We are building more than just a token ecosystem — we’re designing a **living cultural landscape**, where each unit of digital heritage is:
- Anchored in space,
- Tied to coordinates,
- Brought to life.

This park exists in **three parallel dimensions**:
- 🏛 **Physically** — as an evolving, walkable terrain of architecture, sculptures, and curated spaces.
- 🔗 **On-chain** — as a DAO-managed structure of governance, token utility, and NFT provenance.
- 🎭 **Culturally** — as a long-term initiative that safeguards, co-creates, and archives collective memory.

The ultimate goal of GPARK is to create the world’s **first decentralized cultural landscape**:
- Not governed by centralized institutions or private interests,
- But by a **transparent, token-based protocol of participation and presence**.

Each NFT is not just a collectible:
- It’s a **programmable coordinate**,
- A **signal of contribution**,
- A **permanent fixture in a shared spatial narrative**.

---

### 2.2 ✦ Philosophy: Art, Transparency, Memory

Global Park DAO arises from a simple yet vital idea:  
**Culture, art, and memory deserve decentralized foundations.**

We envision a future in which both physical and digital spaces are:
- Not owned or exploited,
- But **co-created, protected, and activated** by the communities that inhabit them.

While institutions and cities are often shaped by invisible hierarchies, GPARK offers an alternative:
- A **programmable space** where rules, access, and growth are defined by **consensus**, not private control.

Our philosophical base rests on **three pillars**:
1. 🎨 **Art as infrastructure** – not decoration, but the backbone of public architecture.
2. 🛡 **Technology as transparency** – every decision, transaction, and permission is recorded on-chain.
3. 🗺 **Memory as coordination** – every object is not just a file or sculpture, but a fragment of shared significance.

Aligned with long-term cultural frameworks such as **Dubai 2040**, the project is not speculative — it is architectural.  
Every coordinate, every participant, every block on-chain is a **building block in a decentralized cultural future**.

---

## 3️⃣ Digital Heritage: From NFTs to Physical Presence

Global Park is not only a place — it is a **living memory system**.  
At the heart of this system lies the **NFT layer**, which enables:
- Digital representation,
- Cultural imprinting,
- Permanent anchoring of contributions to the park’s landscape.

Each NFT minted within the Global Park ecosystem corresponds to a specific **coordinate, object, memory, or conceptual presence**.  
These are not generic collectibles, but rather **nodes of cultural inheritance** — programmable, visible, and co-authored by the community.

### 🎨 The NFT layer serves the following roles:

- 🗺 **Spatial Representation** – Every NFT is tied to a specific zone, object, or experience within the park.
- 🎟 **Access & Activation** – Some functions in the DAO may require possession of a specific NFT (e.g., participation in certain sub-governance groups, creative campaigns, or rituals).
- 🏛 **Curation & Preservation** – NFTs can curate shared memories, represent artist contributions, or mark meaningful events in the DAO’s timeline.

In the **Genesis Phase**, Global Park will launch an initial collection of **10,000 NFTs**, available via **single-mint per wallet**.  
These NFTs may unlock access to early participation incentives and future activations.

Each NFT will be:
- Linked to **ENS metadata**,
- Registered on **IPFS** to ensure decentralization and long-term verifiability.

⚠ **Ownership of an NFT does not guarantee rights or profit**, but offers **cultural presence and optional access** within a limited, shared domain.

---

## 5️⃣ DAO Governance Architecture

Global Park DAO is governed through a **robust, transparent framework** built around:
- A **multisignature treasury**,
- **Verifiable public infrastructure**,
- **Progressive decentralization**.

The model ensures **collective control, resilience, and full visibility** at every development stage.

At its core:
> 🏛 The **DAO Council** composed of five independently held wallet addresses.  
> All key decisions require **3-of-5 multisignature approval** via a **Gnosis Safe** smart contract.

This forms the governance backbone of the **Genesis Phase**, where:
- Foundational infrastructure is deployed,
- The community is formed,
- Operational frameworks are tested.

---

### 🛠 The DAO is organized around:

### ✦ DAO Council

- Five signers responsible for:
  - Treasury transactions,
  - Protocol interactions,
  - Token operations,
  - Governance actions.
- Fully transparent operation via **on-chain multisig system**.

### ✦ DAO Treasury (Gnosis Safe)

- **Address:** `0xd45BA3Fb796CD735715aB6966f198d416EC353C1`
- Central wallet of the DAO.
- Holds and distributes funds based on approved proposals.
- All funds are **non-custodial and controlled via multisig** (ETH, GPARK, partner allocations).

### ✦ Token Contract Ownership

- The **GPARK token smart contract** is fully owned by the DAO Treasury (`Ownable` pattern).
- **Deployer address:** `0x06abf92e99151e2A6122C199878C491a3A487544` — reference only, holds no privileges.
- All privileged functions (e.g. `lockTokens()`, `snapshot()`) can be executed **only via multisig authorization**.

✅ Guarantees:
> No centralized actor can alter token behavior, enforce upgrades, or override permissions.

### ✦ IPFS Governance Records

- All critical documents published and pinned on **IPFS**:
  - Genesis Operating Rules,
  - DAO Wallet Map,
  - Launch Report.
- Verifiably linked via the DAO’s **ENS profile**.

### ✦ ENS Metadata

- **ENS Domain:** `soon..`
- Acts as on-chain identity anchor:
  - Stores `contenthash` (IPFS),
  - DAO Council addresses,
  - Treasury map,
  - Social links,
  - Governance notices,
  - Token contract details.

---

### 🗳 Governance Phases

The roadmap includes a transition from:
- **Genesis Phase (council-led execution)**  
➡ to  
- **Autonomous Phase (community-led voting)**

Upon activation of **Snapshot-based governance**, all GPARK token holders will be empowered to:
- **Propose** and
- **Vote** on decisions directly.

Until then, the **DAO Council acts as an accountable steward**:
> Not for control, but for activating, safeguarding, and documenting the emergence of a decentralized cultural system.

## 6️⃣ The GPARK Token

The **GPARK token** is the native utility asset of the **Global Park DAO ecosystem**.  
It is **not a financial instrument**, but rather a key that unlocks:
- Participation,
- Coordination,
- Activation across both digital and physical dimensions of the park.

Issued through a **fully deployed and immutable smart contract** on Ethereum, GPARK serves three primary functions:

### 🎯 Core Functions

- 🗳 **Governance Participation**  
In future phases, GPARK holders will be able to submit and vote on DAO proposals via **Snapshot**.  
Governance parameters are finalized during the **Genesis Phase** and will activate once sufficient distribution and community presence is achieved.

- 🏛 **Access to Scarce Infrastructure**  
The park has physically limited space.  
GPARK will be required to:
  - Register digital coordinates,
  - Sponsor installations,
  - Represent contributions in collaborative zones.

- 🎭 **Cultural Activation**  
GPARK may be used to:
  - Participate in certain events,
  - Mint NFT objects tied to land,
  - Represent verified participation in collective memory projects.

### 🔗 Smart Contract Details

- **Smart contract address:** `0x470AAb2A10F3b0757Df977C39dDe3475F76f81B9`
- ERC20-compatible token with extended features:
  - `ERC20Permit (EIP-2612)`,
  - `ERC20Votes (Snapshot-compatible)`,
  - Built-in vesting mechanism for contributors and partners.
- No minting privileges, transfer of ownership, or admin functions.
- Lock-up and vesting mechanisms managed by **DAO-approved execution**.

❗ **There is no expectation of profit or investment return.**  
GPARK is designed as a **functional resource** for interaction with the DAO’s protocols, tools, and spaces.  
Value is created through **activation, contribution, and cultural relevance**, not price speculation.

> This document provides a summary.  
> For full details on tokenomics, distribution schedules, deflationary loops, and comparative analysis, see the [Extended Tokenomics Report →](https://github.com/GPARKPRO/GlobalPark-DAO/tree/main/docs)

---

### 6.1 ✦ Token Utility, Scarcity, and DAO-Supported Value

GPARK is a **utility token** at the core of Global Park DAO architecture.  
It plays a critical role in:
- Participation,
- Access,
- Ecosystem expansion.

Every NFT in the park represents a **unique, fixed coordinate**:
- Zones can be used for cultural installations, anchoring presence, or physical activation.
- **NFTs are the only mechanism** for claiming space in the park (both digitally and physically).

✅ **GPARK is required** for:
- Minting NFTs,
- Transferring NFTs,
- Activating NFTs.

As the DAO grows, the GPARK amount required for **high-value coordinates** may increase.

The total supply of NFTs is **capped** and will not be expanded:
> This is not artificial scarcity but an architectural principle.  
> Space is finite, making every NFT inherently valuable.

---

### 🎯 Economic Logic and DAO Incentive Structure

Although GPARK is **not intended for financial speculation**, the DAO naturally aims to sustain long-term demand to support:

- 🏗 Physical construction of park zones
- 🛠 Development of governance tooling
- 🎨 Cultural programming and public activations
- 🌐 Global representation and institutional outreach

The DAO **does not manage the price of GPARK**, but it creates conditions where the token reflects:
- **Real participation**
- **Contribution**
- **Community-driven activity**

Every NFT-related transaction:
- Minting,
- Transfer,
- Zone assignment  
➡ **Returns value to the DAO treasury.**

All funds are **reinvested into the project** and **never redistributed to holders**.

> Any token or NFT price increases serve the project’s infrastructure and public cultural layers, not personal gain.

---

## 7️⃣ Treasury & Financial Design

Global Park DAO maintains a **transparent, on-chain treasury** governed by a **3-of-5 multisignature Council**.  
The treasury:
- Is not controlled by any single individual or entity,
- Operates solely through **DAO-approved actions**.

### ✦ Treasury Address (Gnosis Safe)

`0xd45BA3Fb796CD735715aB6966f198d416EC353C1`

All funds (ETH, GPARK tokens, NFT-related income) are:
> 🛡 Managed through this Safe and publicly viewable on-chain.

---

### ✦ Council-Controlled Execution

Every outgoing transaction:
- Must be approved by at least **three of five Council members**,
- Is fully verifiable on-chain.

This guarantees:
- ✅ Maximum transparency,
- ✅ Accountability,
- ✅ Resilience against centralized misuse.

---

### ✦ Funding Philosophy

Global Park is:
- ❌ Not an investment vehicle.
- ✅ A **public-good oriented cultural structure**.

Funds are used to:
- 🏗 Support infrastructure,
- 🎭 Community engagement,
- 🎨 Art projects,
- 🛠 Maintenance and development.

❗ There are **no profit guarantees**, and funds will not be used to enrich any individual actor.

---

### ✦ Sources of Treasury Growth (Non-Speculative)

- 🪙 Minting fees from NFTs
- 🎨 Cultural partnerships and curation programs
- 🏛 Grants or public support funds
- 🔗 Contributions from aligned DAOs or institutions
- 🌐 Token-based community initiatives

---

### ✦ Spending Principles

- 📝 All expenditures must be **proposed, documented, and approved by the DAO**.
- 🎯 Spending is evaluated on:
  - **Mission alignment**
  - **Cultural and public value**
- Budgets may include:
  - 🏗 Infrastructure
  - 🎭 IRL activations
  - 🛠 Digital tooling
  - 🏛 DAO operations

> The treasury exists not to accumulate wealth,  
> but to sustain, activate, and grow a **living cultural ecosystem**.  
> Every token, every ETH spent is participation in a **shared legacy**.
