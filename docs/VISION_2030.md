# Vision 2030: A Cultural Protocol for Memory and Participation

### *A Decentralized Initiative for Art, Technology & Collective Memory*  
**Global Park DAO | April 2025**

---

## From Prototype to Cultural Infrastructure

By **2030**, Global Park DAO aims to evolve from an experimental prototype into a **trusted global infrastructure** for public memory, cultural participation, and decentralized stewardship.

Rather than being seen as a “Web3 project,” **GPARK** will be understood as a lasting platform where **physical space and digital heritage converge** — governed by people, not platforms.

---

## 10+ Cities, One DAO

Global Park will operate across at least **ten cities** — each with its own site, local partnerships, and community — yet connected through a **shared governance model**.

The **GPARK token** will serve as a coordination tool, enabling decisions across a distributed ecosystem while respecting local specificity.

---

## A Living Map of Presence

Over **1 million NFT coordinates** may be created — not as speculative assets, but as **symbolic markers** of contribution, remembrance, or creative action.

Together, these coordinates form a **collective memory map**:
- 📍 **Browsable online**
- 🏞️ **Walkable in physical parks**
- 🗳️ **Governed by a transparent DAO**

> Each entry reflects **participation**, not **possession**.

---

## A Decentralized Cultural Fund

By 2030, the **GPARK Treasury** will operate as a **public fund** — allocating resources to artists, urban initiatives, and memory-driven projects.

All allocations will be governed by:
- 🗳️ Community proposals
- ✅ DAO voting
- 📖 Full transparency

> Demonstrating how **collective resources** can be distributed without centralized institutions, profit motives, or opaque boards.

---

## Legal and Civic Recognition

Global Park DAO will collaborate with **regulatory innovators** — such as **RAK DAO**, **DMCC**, and public partners — to establish a **legal architecture for decentralized cultural institutions**.

> Rather than replacing law, GPARK **complements** civic systems  
> by introducing **new coordination mechanisms** — fair, transparent, and collective.

---

## Civic Partnership and Urban Culture

Through partnerships with city governments, ministries of culture, and local institutions, **GPARK** will help **reimagine how public space is shaped**:

- 🗿 Public sculptures and digital inscriptions  
- 🏛️ Participatory pavilions and civic rituals  
- 🧪 Urban experiments designed by communities, funded by the DAO

> This is **urban diplomacy through shared authorship** —  
> a new way to connect people, stories, and place.

---

## Educational and Ethical Contribution

By 2030, Global Park may be featured in:

- 🏫 University courses on **digital culture and urbanism**  
- 📚 Academic studies on **decentralized governance**  
- 🏛️ Policy discussions on the **ethics of public memory**

The DAO’s token model will be referenced **not for speculation** —  
but as a case study in **collective coordination**, **transparency**, and **cultural integrity**.

---

## Our Commitment

Global Park is not a token.  
It is not a product.  
It is a **cultural commitment**.

To **presence**.  
To **legacy**.  
To **participation**.

---

> If we stay grounded in our mission —  
> and build with care, ethics, and openness —  
> then by 2030, GPARK may be seen as:

> **“A foundation for decentralized heritage.”**  
> A shared space between **blockchain and memory**,  
> between **code and community**.
